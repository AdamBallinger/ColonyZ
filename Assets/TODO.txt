Regions:
- Split world into chunks, and flood each chunk to get the individual regions. Work out how to calculate
adjacent regions and store them.

Pathing:
- Look into splitting the node graph into chunks to try speed up the pathfinder on large maps?
- This would be tricky to handle if chunks are split into multiple accessible parts though. Eg. Inaccessible 
"rooms" being created or formed in the chunk, or spread into other chunks.

Jobs:
- Updating the closest working tile for a job as the entity gets closer? Currently looks odd when the characters
go to the closest tile assigned from where the entity was assigned the job, which could change by the time
the entity reaches the job. Old system was slow as it was constantly checking surrounding tiles of the job
for a new closest based on the entities current position. Maybe do this only if the entity position changes on
the x or y to signal the entity is now on a different "side" of the target tile from when it was assigned?

Flooring:
- How to handle building flooring on a tile?? Should this modify the actual tile graphic through the world
shader, or should it be a new buildable object, separate to the TileObject system currently. 
- Same for building paths outside.

World Shader:
- Blending tiles so transitions between tile types isn't solid and ugly. Same for paths / flooring maybe?

Toolbar:
- This is a mess again and could do with being reworked properly so its not a spaghetti mess..
