RoomManager.cs: Fucking pain in the ass
- Fix flooding so that it allows a room to to be enclosed by trees, but prevent the flood fill from flooding 
every single tile in the world when a single tile is built for some reason. I dont even know why tbh.
- Add an indoors flag to rooms that have a "roof". A room can have a roof if it is smaller than a specific width
and height, as well as not having any objects such as trees inside of them?
- Trees enclosing rooms wont be easy since the flood fill uses Tile::IsExposedToOutside to determine if the
tile is in a room or not. Having trees flagged as encloses room means the entire map gets flooded every time
a tile is placed that encloses a room...
- Maybe need to re think how to check if a room is enclosed, rather than recursively checking if a tile is
in line of sight of the edge of the map. This is going to be slow on large maps.

Pathing:
- Look into splitting the node graph into chunks to try speed up the pathfinder on large maps?
- This would be tricky to handle if chunks are split into multiple accessible parts though. Eg. Inaccessible 
"rooms" being created or formed in the chunk, or spread into other chunks.

Jobs:
- Updating the closest working tile for a job as the entity gets closer? Currently looks odd when the characters
go to the closest tile assigned from where the entity was assigned the job, which could change by the time
the entity reaches the job. Old system was slow as it was constantly checking surrounding tiles of the job
for a new closest based on the entities current position. Maybe do this only if the entity position changes on
the x or y to signal the entity is now on a different "side" of the target tile from when it was assigned?

Flooring:
- How to handle building flooring on a tile?? Should this modify the actual tile graphic through the world
shader, or should it be a new buildable object, separate to the TileObject system currently. 
- Same for building paths outside.

World Shader:
- Blending tiles so transitions between tile types isn't solid and ugly. Same for paths / flooring maybe?
