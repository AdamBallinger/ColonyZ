Flooring:
- How to handle building flooring on a tile?? Should this modify the actual tile graphic through the world
shader, or should it be a new buildable object, separate to the TileObject system currently. 
- Same for building paths outside.

World Shader:
- Blending tiles so transitions between tile types isn't solid and ugly. Same for paths / flooring maybe?

Toolbar:
- This is a mess again and could do with being reworked properly so its not a spaghetti mess..

BuildModeController:
- Should be moved outside of Controller namespace and into models since it isn't a class that integrates with Unity.. 
Should be an instance created inside of world. Could also do with a rename to something more "Work" related, 
as that is effectively what it is.

Items / Objects / Sprites:
- Ditch scriptable objects? Load this data through json? Needs work, as I don't like mixing the scriptable object
stuff into the Models namespace, and makes the loading process a pain.

Regions:
- Region updates currently force all neighbouring chunks to be rebuilt. Need a way of detecting which neighbours, if
any, should be updated instead.
